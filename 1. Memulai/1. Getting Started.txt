Tutorial 01 - Getting started

The goal of this tutorial is to scaffold, install and run your first Invenio instance. This step is identical to the Quickstart
Step 1: Prerequisites

First ensure you have prepared your environment according to the guide.
Step 2: Checkout source code

First, open a terminal and checkout the trainings' source code:

$ cd ~/src
$ git clone https://github.com/inveniosoftware/training.git

Tip: To copy/paste into the terminal inside the Ubuntu virtual machine use: Ctrl+Shift+V (paste), Ctrl+Shift+C (copy), Ctrl+Shift+X (cut).
Step 3: Scaffold

Scaffold the skeleton for your first Invenio instance:

$ cookiecutter gh:inveniosoftware/cookiecutter-invenio-instance -c v3.4 --no-input

Step 4: Install

Navigate to the scaffolded code, and start the Docker services (database, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and Redis cache):

$ cd my-site
$ docker-compose up -d

Install and build the Python and NPM dependencies:

$ ./scripts/bootstrap

Step 5: Run

Setup the database tables, search indexes, queues and caches:

$ ./scripts/setup

Start a development server and background job worker:

$ ./scripts/server

Last, open https://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser:

$ firefox https://127.0.0.1:5000/

Firefox and other browsers will display a security warning because we are trying to open a secure connection to a server with a self-signed certificate:
